# C++ Parallel & Concurrent Programming

## Prerequisites to Build and Debug Project in VS Code

- **MinGW-w64** (or similar GCC toolchain for Windows)
- **VS Code** with the C/C++ extension (ms-vscode.cpptools)

## Building the Project

1. Open `main.cpp` in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build the project
3. The executable will be created in the same directory

## Debugging the Project

1. Open `main.cpp` in VS Code
2. Press `F5` to start debugging
3. Set breakpoints by clicking on the left margin of the code editor

## Running the Program

After building, you can run the program from the terminal:

```bash
.\main.exe
```

## Project Structure

- `main.cpp` - Main source file
- `.vscode/tasks.json` - Build configuration
- `.vscode/launch.json` - Debug configuration
- `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` - IntelliSense configuration
